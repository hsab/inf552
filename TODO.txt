1. Add choice for 8 transformations.

2. implement the other 2 patch placement method.

3. Adapting the Cost Function

1. Scaling

2. add support for black-and-white images (uchar instead of Vec3b? template?)

3. intelligent determination of iteration needed (satisfactory error rate?)

2. FFT-acceleration?

4. Feathering and multi-resolution splining?
